LocationFinder is a program that allows users to perform the following activities:
- Find the location of a device using an IP address
- Find the location of a device using a phone number
- Find the location of a device using a URL
Before I continue, I want to make something very clear. LocationFinder is not to be used for malicious purposes as such are illegal in the court of law.
I will not able be held liable or responsible for anyone who decides to oppose this rule.
This program was designed with positive and ethical purposes in mind and should only be used by enthusiasts, cybersecurity experts and network administrators.

Right now, the program is quite small and relatively basic. However, the program will receive more features in the near future.
The program was written in Python as the following Python modules were used:
- phonenumbers
- socket
- ip2geotools
